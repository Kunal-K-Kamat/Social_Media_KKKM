# Social Media Website - Vibely

This application facilitates core functionalities such as user registration, secure login, profile creation and editing, and content sharing. 
Additionally, it includes analytical features that offer insights into user activity, interactions, and engagement. 
Built using a Python-based web framework like Django or Flask, the backend logic is cleanly separated from the frontend, which is constructed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 
This separation ensures modularity and easier maintenance, while responsive design techniques ensure the application works seamlessly across devices.
